Team All American Rejects
Pirate Island Escape (PIE) Readme

1. How to Play

You are trying to get to the other side of the island as fast as possible. Collect coins and avoid enemies along the way while jumping onto platforms to reach the goal. Use precise movement to get to hard to reach areas. Once, you reach the other side, step onto the end platform to escape. The objective of the game is to get as high of a score as possible.

2. Technology Requirements

The goal of the game is to get from point A to point B with as many points as possible. Faster clear times are rewarded with higher scores. Additionally, there are collectables that you may find on your way that can also increase your score. There are enemies that roam the island that will target you if you get near them. If they manage to deplete your health points, then you will be punished by losing points and having to start over from a checkpoint.

We will guide the player through their task by panning over from the goal to the starting area when the player begins the game. We will use collectables and enemies to show the path to the goal, but they will not serve as strict markers as some collectibles will be placed out of the way to serve as a choice for the player. 

Our environment is created from an asset from the Unity store, but we put more objects onto the field. For instance, a mountain. We will be sure to include more objects to make the environment unique and a fun experience for the future. We don’t have that many objects the player can interact with at the time, but there are collectibles on the map the user can interact with, and a platform on the other side of the map to end the game. 

Enemies currently have a basic AI script that follows the player when they are near. We plan to improve this script by adding more states to make the game more engaging. We also want to include NPCs in our game, so we need to create an AI script for them as well.

In terms of polish, we do have a start screen and end screen for the game, but work needs to be done with making it more appealing to the eyes. We also need to implement a pause screen. We also need to update our enemies to be more in-line with our main character’s style.

3. Issues 

Currently, we are using a placeholder script for player movement because our current script is not working. We are trying to fix the issues with it, but don’t have enough time to fix it by the alpha deadline. The issue we have with the movement is that the player is currently only moving in place. The professor said this could be an issue with not having root motion in the first place. We might have to start over from scratch and implement a better way to do this, like creating new mecanim animations for the model instead of using the provided ones.
